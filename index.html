			<h2>PORTFOLIO | Erin Carlson</h2>
		</div>

		<p><h3>Erin graduated <i>magna cum laude</i> from Cornell University in 2011 with a double major in English and Spanish. She promptly surprised everyone she knew--and particularly herself--by accepting a job in an engineering capacity at MicroStrategy. Since then, her interests have grown in a more technical direction, but her penchant for spontaneous international travel, long walks in DC, and warm chocolate croissants remains unchanged.</h3></p>

		<p><h3>While many of her engineering-related endeavors are proprietary information, here is a sampling of a few personal and professional projects:</h3></p>

        <p>The few short days that the Cherry Blossoms will finally bloom is the perennial DC enigma--that, and government conspiracies, I suppose. This year I chose to take a methodical approach to predicting the exact day so that I could plan my vacations accordingly.</p>
        <p>EARLY BLOOMERS | While the exact day that the Cherry Blossoms bloom varies widely, it appears that the DC Cherry Blossoms have been blooming around 5 days earlier than when they were planted in 1921. Or so the liberal media has been claiming. Is there any evidence to back up these claims? Let's start with their dataset.</p>
        	<img class="img-responsive" src="../images/daysin.png">
        <p>DRAMATIC DECADES | When you look at the decade-level averages, the change appears even more pronounced--perhaps the media got it right. Perhaps it is time to investigate whether this is due to the increased maturity of trees, lack of data for the 2010s, environmental factors, or something else?</p>
        	<img class="img-responsive" src="../images/decades.png">
        <p>HYPOTHESIS 1: INCOMPLETE DATA | I obtained the cherry blossom data for 2013-2015 which normalized the data somewhat. It appears that the cherry blossoms are blooming a day or two earlier than the average. Was the lack of data the only factor?</p>
        	<img class="img-responsive" src="../images/hypothesis1.png">
        <p>HYPOTHESIS 2: ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS | When plotting the number of severe weather incidents from the first of January to the day of peak bloom, there appears to be no correlation.</p>

        <h2>FEATURE</h2>
        <p>As a BI administrator, I want to grant users access to enterprise data sources and other resources in a governed manner so that they can effectively interact with enterprise ecosystemâ€”without incurring unintended and far-reaching consequences.</p>
        <h3>DETAILS</h3>
        <p>Every data analyst has been on the receiving end of a frantic email from the IT team after submitting a large, complex, and/or server-crushing query. It happens. We need to ensure that the appropriate governance is in place to limit this sort of interaction.

        <p>In order to do this, the following steps will be necessary:
        <ul>
        	<li>Define a set of intelligent default governing settlngs for end users, with the possibility for administrator override</li>
        	<li>Surface a variety of server governing controls to administrators</li>
        	<li>Expose a set of query statistics and functionality so that business analyst can gauge the impact and performance of his/her queries</li>
        	<li>Augment the alerting capabilities to ensure administrators are aware of long-running queries</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      <h2>USER STORY</h2>
      <p>As an administrator, I want to define a set of query size limit controls so that my users are running better-performing queries that serves the double purpose of not stressing the underlying enterprise resources.</p>
      <h3>DETAILS</h3>
        <p>In order to do this, we should surface a setting in the Server Administration properties dialog that empowers administrators specify how many total rows that they feel comfortable sending to the database server. If exceeded, the error message ought to instruct users to contact their administrators to increase the number of allowed rows.</p>

        <h2>PORTFOLIO ITEM</h2>
        <p><b>Governed Data Discovery | How to Ensure a Win-Win Outcome that IT Administrators, BI Users, and Business Analysts can Agree On</b></p>
        <p>As a BI administrator, I want to know that I will be able to provide a best-in-class experience to my data analysts while balancing the needs of the IT department, so that the power of data discovery is balanced by system- and IT-defined governance.</p>
        <h3>DETAILS</h3>
        <p>The proliferation of desktop data analysis tools connecting directly to enterprise resources frequently results in stressed or failing IT resources. Customers frequently cite scenarios where servers are brought down by adhoc queries made against at-capacity database servers as the most common problem. The ultimate result of these hardware failure scenarios is additional stress on system administrators who are expected to triage such situations, service disruptions for BI users using standard reports, and frustration with respect to performance on the business analyst side.</p>
        <p><b>In order to support all of these user personas, we need to find ways to effectively and intelligently govern adhoc access to enterprise assets while still advocating for a powerful adhoc user experience.</b></p>

        <h2>STEP 1: Devise a User Research Strategy</h2>
        <p>As part of the planning process for a next-generation research project, I was asked by the CEO to meet up with internal stakeholders and understand their processes, metrics, and current pain points. Given the system proliferation and sensitivity of data handled by the Human Resources team, I chose them as my first research subject. Prior to the first meeting, I collaborated across multiple teams to develop a short questionnaire that would help us to better understand their use cases, and made some soft hypotheses about user roles to help guide the discussion.</p>

        <img class="img-responsive" src="../images/SketchUserRoles.jpg">
		
		<h2>STEP 2: Diagram the User Processes and Stated Goals</h2>
        <p>During the user interview, I created a freeform sketch that detailed the information they conveyed. This sketch ended up being instrumental to the conversation, as they were immediately able to correct any misapprehensions. </p>

        <img class="img-responsive" src="../images/SketchProcess.jpg">

		<h2>STEP 3: Examine Requirements in Light of the Overall Product Vision</h2>
        <p>After documenting and disseminating feedback to the team and CEO, I decided to take a step back and examine the relationship between the new requirements and the vision statement devised by the team. From there, I examined the convergence points between the vision, the current product, and the new information about HR processes. It became clear that the requirements for better transparency and access to certain types of data was in line with the guiding principles that had been set.</p>

        <img class="img-responsive" src="../images/SketchVision.jpg">

        <h2>STEP 4: Formulate a Simple Low-Fidelity Workflow</h2>
        <p>As you can certainly perceive, if you are still reading this, design may not my wheelhouse, but it is a powerful communication tool. Since I had validated with myself and stakeholders the importance of this information, I went a step further to quickly examine the information architecture of the items that the HR department would expect to see on a page. Using that information, I then ideated a quick and dirty workflow that an HR business partner could theoretically follow.</p>

        <img class="img-responsive" src="../images/SketchWorkflow.jpg">

        <h2>STEP 5: Validate Assumptions using Low-Fidelity Interface Design</h2>
        <p>While I am very much a proponent of empowering designers with information and letting them extrapolate the perfect workflow, I always find it helpful to validate my ideas by ensuring that they fit into the design of an interface. Then I am able to confidently advocate for the elements that I perceive are most important to the user and I have a good basis of understanding how and why I reached that conclusion. Word to the Wise: This step is frequently a trap for perfectionists, as the siren song of high-fidelity mockups calls out over-so-alluringly. Don't give in--this is a work in progress!</p>
