		Erin graduated magna cum laude from Cornell University in 2011 with a double major in English and Spanish, and promptly surprised everyone--particularly herself--by accepting a job in an engineering capacity at MicroStrategy. Since then, her interests have grown in a more technical direction, but her affection for traveling, hiking, reading, and warm chocolate croissants remains unchanged.
