    			<p><b>AWS Database Blog | May 23, 2018</b></p>
    			<p>Using Amazon RDS, AWS customers can quickly and easily set up, operate, and scale their relational databases in the cloud. Amazon RDS Reserved Instances (RIs) give customers the option to reserve a database instance for a one- or three- year term, which can translate into significant discounts as compared to On-Demand prices.

    			<p><b>AWS Startups Blog &vert; July 6, 2017</b></p>
    			<p>With AWS, you only pay for what you use, which results in a variable cost model, much like a utility bill. The more you use, the more you pay, and the less you use, the less you pay. Though this cost model can mean significant infrastructure cost savings for your organization, it also might require you to think differently about architecting, managing, and operating in your AWS environment.
