			<h3></h3>
			<h3></h3>
			<p>The Technology Associate role is a rotational program at MicroStrategy where individuals spend time in Technical Support, Quality Engineering, and, ultimately, Beta Consulting. The Associate Product Manager position was an unplanned but exciting detour midway through my Quality Engineering rotation.</p>

			<h3><b>Beta Consultant</b> | Beta Software Team</h3>
				<p>Visited Fortune 500 companies to test beta software and demo new features, gathered customer feedback and reported back to stakeholders, and simultaneously led internal operational reporting projects focused customer satisfaction, performance tuning, and issue tracking.</p>

			<h3><b>Associate Product Manager</b> | Mobile Marketing</h3>
				<p>In addition to writing the first edition of <i>The Platform Approach to Mobile Apps</i> interactive iBook and creating the new <i>Introduction to Mobile</i> class for sales prospects and existing customers, I developed scripts, recorded voiceovers, and created app walkthrough videos.</p>

			<h3><b>Associate Product Quality Engineer</b> | Analytical Engine</h3>
				<p>While my main focus was testing the iOS and Flash capabilities on early builds of the new Report-Writing Engine and SmartClient technology, I also developed advanced test suites for freeform feature testing, logging over 100 defects in 4 months.</p>

			<h3><b>Technical Support Engineer</b> | Client Experience</h3>
				<p>Solved mission-critical customer issues via call and email in a fast-paced environment, frequently recognized as the team's top case taker.</p>
