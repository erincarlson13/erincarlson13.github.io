			<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

			<p><p><h3>Erin graduated with honors from Cornell University in 2011 with a double major in English and Spanish. She promptly surprised everyone she knew--and, most particularly, herself--by accepting an engineering role. Since then, her interests have grown in a more technical direction, but her penchant for spontaneous international travel, morning walks, and warm chocolate croissants remains unchanged.</h3></p>

			<h2>TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATE</h2>

			<p>The Technology Associate role is a rotational program at MicroStrategy where individuals spend time in Technical Support, Quality Engineering, and, ultimately, Beta Consulting. The Associate Product Manager position was an unplanned but exciting detour midway through my Quality Engineering rotation, which equipped me with the skills I needed to handle another unexpected career maneuver &mdash serving as the CEO's technical liaison for over a year.</p>
